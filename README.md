# DBBenchmarks

Small java application to run a set of tests against a local database (Postgres)

checkout the repo locally and run `mvn install` to create the executable .jar under /target folder
**IMPORTANT** if the default .jar doesn't run (it's probably the JDBC driver missing) use he fat version `DBBenchmarks-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
